                <p>Throughout the last year, I wanted to build a personal website. However, set it aside day after day until my friend made his own. <br><br> Finally, <span id="keyword">I built it.</span>    </p>
                
                
                <div class="subtitle">
                    What about the blog will be?
                </div>
                
                <p>Everything about <span id = "keyword">software engineering, workout, reading, and travel</span>. Maybe I publish my pet projects here and also will share the development process: anything related to the backend, problems I faced, new things learned, etc.</p>

                <div class="subtitle">
                    Reading
                </div>

                <p>In 2021, I’ve read <span id ="keyword" >23 books, 6465 pages, and 329 (90.1%) days</span>. Now, I quit. <br>Need to resume.</p>
                
                <p>There will be a little feedback and rating on books that I've read. Along with my thoughts on the way I understood the messages of authors.</p>

                <div class="subtitle">
                    Workout
                </div>

                <p>PRs (personal records), nutrition, weight gain and process.</p>

                <div class="subtitle">
                    Summary
                </div>

                <p>Structure of the blog:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span id = "tags">pets</span> - personal projects</li>
                    <li><span id = "tags">dev</span> - software development</li>
                    <li><span id = "tags">workout</span> - sport</li>
                    <li><span id = "tags">read</span> - book review</li>
                    <li><span id = "tags">thoughts</span> - personal opinion on anything</li>
                </ul>


                <br>
                <p>Overall, I want to share content that will be valuable for my reader. <br>Stay in touch and <span id="keyword">aman bol!</span></p>
